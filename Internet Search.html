    <br><h1 class="text-center"> Internet Search </h1><br>
    <p class="text-justify">With the absence of Google or any other search engine, a decade ago, getting the millions of sites of accurate data was impossible. And half a decade before that, searching consisted of only text-based links with monotonous, unfiltered data which was not updated on regular terms. We can say here, that Yahoo started the game pretty well. It created the chance for information being pure and helpful.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">With initiation of the web, no individual used it for commerce or any other relevant purpose. The very idea was considered heretical even evil by some. With time and such arguments around the web industry, the debate became fierce and the end result came to be known as advertising. The web, was then realised, to be the biggest opportunity for marketing and sales of any product or service.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">With this point in debates and discussion, a certain part realised that Internet is not just for business, trade or commerce. It is to be considered as freedom. The students of different universities considered this option of freedom to a new revolution.</p>
    <br><br><img src="Images\Internet Search.jpg" class="d-block w-100" alt="..."><br><br>
    <p class="text-justify">Let us have a look in the initiation of thought process for search. Two students, Yang and Filo, in the process of hacking a series basketball matches to know whom to bet on, started to extract all the data from the web. Their only intention seen here was gambling, but these Electronics Engineering students, with this knowledge realised soon, that web is goldmine. They started using banner ads and were always in a thought process to understand that, this process will work or not, and they found their way out, because it happened.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">By 2007, Google and Yahoo! made billions and billions of dollars, but still no one used it for business or commerce. Then the era of advertisement took over and still reluctant to choose their faith, they had their views.
        Even though excite came as a good competition for Yahoo!, none of them had developed the skills to search accurate data on real-time basis. With these new hotshot companies in a healthy rivalry and race to develop new updates and features, a new name emerged, Google, which meant 10 to the power of hundred, with their founders as barely socializing college students, Page and Brin. They came up with a simple methodology of searching. The hits on a particular link can measure the accuracy of information mentioned in that page. Even though their idea was great and in later years to be recognized well, investors did not pay a heed at the expected level at that point of time.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">With every ray of light comes a new day, in the same way, for Page and Brin, Billy Gross was the light. The night was long, took a lot of time, but at the end, they got what they needed the most. They used his code and later on with Gross itself, the started the revenue on web with ads.
        Slowly and steadily, Google moved ahead and bagged the search market so well, that excite then, became a history. With Yahoo!, still in competition with Google, they try and produce new every day.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">In 2004, Google was on NASDAQ stock market. Almost within half a decade, it boosted more revenue than many companies from different sectors such as consumable products, service companies and what not.
        With this, we can understand the simplicity, usability and customer attraction gainer, Google became. A company whose shares were sold at around $100 to $200, were sold at seven to eight times higher rates of the actual buying rate. But with every rise, there is a fall and with every companionship comes rivalry too. Google maybe ahead in the race, but there are many competitors in this industry who think, try and execute plans to beat Google in the search industry. Then emerged a powerful company, which had the ability to the show stopper and grow its roots deep in the industry. It was Microsoft. They were late but they certainly had the ability to crack the code. But what John Naughton phrases is a great point to understand. He says, “Good luck in making Google reveal its algorithm” and the secret lies within the algorithm itself. Rise and fall are inevitable and are meant to happen in way or the other. As still we can see, Google has not taken a fall yet, but only time can tell what the scenario can be.
